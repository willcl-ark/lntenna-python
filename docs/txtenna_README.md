# TxTenna-Python Example Script

The TxTenna Python project is an example script that demonstrates how you can use an offline computer with an attached [goTenna Mesh](http://gotennamesh.com) radio to settle Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. This script also provides an example of how an offline computer can relay over the TxTenna Mesh network arbitrary data received from the [Blockstream Blocksat](https://blockstream.com/satellite/) and uplinked using the [Blocksat API example](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/tree/master/api/examples) scripts.

This project is inspired by the ideas of the [Mule Tools](http://mule.tools) initiative and uses a JSON based messaging protocol derived from the mobile [TxTenna App](https://TxTenna.com) and [TxTenna Server](https://github.com/MuleTools/txTenna-server) projects. The [txtenna.py](lntenna/api/txtenna.py) example script builds on the [sample.py](https://github.com/gotenna/PublicSDK/blob/master/python-public-sdk/sample.py) script created for the goTenna [Public SDK](https://gotenna.com/pages/sdk#sdk-signup).

## <a name='Environment'></a>Environment

The first step in order to use the examples that follow is to prepare the environment.

For Python, create a virtual environment with the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file of this directory. For example, if using *virtualenvwrapper*, run the following:

```
mkvirtualenv --python=`which python2` -r requirements.txt txtenna
```

Note this virtual environment will be required for all example scripts described in this page. Hence, once you open a new terminal session in order to launch txtenna.py, ensure you activate the environment again. For example, assuming you are using `virtualenvwrapper`, run the following on every new terminal session:

 ```
 workon txtenna
 ```

 Use the 'deactivate' command if you want to stop using the environment.

> NOTE: for a quick introduction to *virtualenvwrapper* visit their
> [introduction
> page](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#introduction).
> Also, after installing *virtualenvwrapper*, make sure to follow the shell
> startup instructions on [their
> documentation](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#shell-startup-file).

You will also need to do the following:

* request a free SDK Token, from goTenna [here](https://www.gotenna.com/pages/sdk).
* plug a [goTenna Mesh](https://gotennamesh.com) device into the USB port of your computer (RPi, PC, Mac, Linux, etc)
* From the settings menu of the [TxTenna App](https://txtenna.com) on your phone, set the 'goTenna Token' to match the one you use with the txtenna.py examples below.

> IMPORTANT: Make sure your goTennas are upgraded to firmware 1.1.12 or higher following the [instructions from the goTenna Python SDK](https://github.com/gotenna/PublicSDK/blob/master/python-public-sdk/Mesh%20Firmware%20Upgrade%20to%201.1.12.pdf).

> NOTE: if you will be accessing a local [bitcoind](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) daemon, we use the [getrawtransaction](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#getrawtransaction) RPC call which expects a local **indexed** installation of bitcoind.

> WARNING: This project has not had a professional security review and should only be used for research and testing.

# Troubleshooting

* You may need to install the [77-gotenna.rules](https://github.com/gotenna/PublicSDK/blob/master/python-public-sdk/77-gotenna.rules) file for linux systems that use the udev device manager.
* If you change your SDK Token, delete the .goTenna file created by txtenna.py .
* Either use sudo to run Python or use chmod to grant access to your USB serial device if you see this error:

        SerialException: [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'
        ERROR:goTenna.driver.Driver:Failed to connect to device!
* You can plug in two goTennas and test communication between them from different shell windows.
* To test txtenna-python with the TxTenna app ou must [build a version of the TxTenna App](https://github.com/MuleTools/txTenna) that uses the same [SDK Token](https://gotenna.com/pages/sdk#sdk-signup) as you use with txtenna-python.

## Example 4: Relay Blocksat Data (from an offline Blocksat connected computer)

Testing this feature theoretically involves three systems:

- System A: An internet connected computer that pays to broadcast some data via the Blockstream satellite network using the Blocksat API example script [api_data_sender](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/blob/master/api/examples/api_data_sender.py).
- System B: An offline computer that receives data from system A via a Blockstream Satellite Receiver and the Blocksat API example script [api_data_reader](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/blob/master/api/examples/api_data_reader.py) and then relays it to system C using a goTenna Mesh radio and txtenna.py .
- System C: An offline computer that receives data from system A using a goTenna Mesh radio, txtenna.py and the Blocksat API example script [api_data_reader](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/blob/master/api/examples/api_data_reader.py) instead of using a Blockstream Satellite Receiver.

Although these systems will normally be different computers, you can also run this test from a single internet connected machine without a satellite receiver to observe how it works. Follow the steps for the Blocksat API [Example 3](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/tree/master/api/examples#example-3-testing-the-api-while-receiving-data-directly-via-internet) to simulate sending and receiving data, and pay with a testnet lightning payment. 

If using a single computer and a simulated Blocksat, each of the systems should be a different console window and you will need to connect both goTenna Mesh radios to the same computer via USB ports.

### System A (online data sender)

Follow the instructions to setup the Blockstream Blocksat API environment and run [Example 3](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/tree/master/api/examples#example-3-testing-the-api-while-receiving-data-directly-via-internet). You should first run 'demo-rx.py' with the --net test flag in one window to simulate a satellite receiver. 

    (blocksat-api) $ ./demo-rx.py --net test
    Connecting with Satellite API server...
    Connected. Waiting for events...

then in a new window run 'api_data_sender.py' with the --net test flag to use the Blocksat API testnet interface.

    (blocksat-api) macbook-pro-5:examples richard$ ./api_data_sender.py --net test -f manifesto.txt

Before you pay the lightning invoice with a testnet lightning wallet, setup and run the scripts on Systems B and C.

### System B (mesh and satellite connected data receiver/relay)

Follow the instructions to setup the Blockstream Blocksat API environment and run [Examples 3](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/tree/master/api/examples#example-3-testing-the-api-while-receiving-data-directly-via-internet). Run 'api_data_reader.py' with the --plaintext flag to read Blocksat API data written to the /tmp/blocksat/api named pipe. The --plaintext flag ensures that all data received will be written to the 'downloads' directory (eg. ./downloads), including encrypted data meant for someone else.

    (blocksat-api) $ ./api_data_reader.py --plaintext
    Waiting for data...

    Saved in downloads/20190416134141.

In a different window, follow the instructions to setup the TxTenna-Python environment (described above) and run 'txtenna.py' with the '--send_dir' argument set to the directory where 'api_data_reader.py' will save file data (eg. ../blockstream/satellite/api/examples/downloads/).

    succeeded!

If data exists in the specified send_dir directory, that data will be broadcast over the goTenna Mesh radio. All other goTenna Mesh radios within range will receive the data. 

### System C (mesh connected data receiver)

Follow the instructions to setup the Blockstream Blocksat API environment and run [Examples 3](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite/tree/master/api/examples#example-3-testing-the-api-while-receiving-data-directly-via-internet). Run 'api_data_reader.py' with the --pipe /tmp/blocksat/api2 flag to read Blocksat API data written to the /tmp/blocksat/api2 named pipe. Also use the --plaintext flag to ensure that all data received will be saved. Data will be written to the 'downloads' directory so you should run ./api_data_reader.py from a different directory to avoid writing data to the same downloads directory being read from by the System B txtenna.py script. Changing to a new directory is only and specifying a second pipe are only required if you are testing on a single system.

    (blocksat-api) $ mkdir system_c
    (blocksat-api) $ cd system_c
    (blocksat-api) $ ../api_data_reader.py --plaintext --pipe /tmp/blocksat/api2

### Conclusion

At the end of this test, the data sent by System A should appear in the download directories of Systems B and C. There can be any number of mesh connected System C machines receiving the data and System A can specifically encrypt data for any one of them. This example shows how a single offline system with a Blocksat can distribute API data to many more offline nodes operating on a local goTenna Mesh network.
